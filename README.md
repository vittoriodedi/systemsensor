This repository contains my “Sistemi Elettronici e Sensori per l'Informatica” course final project.

## Overview

For the final exam, we worked in pairs to complete **four technical reports**, each focused on different key topics in the field of the course. Each report is stored in its dedicated folder and may include both written documentation and source code. The goal was to demonstrate analytical, experimental, and programming skills across multiple domains, from FPGA usage to signal processing and data visualization.

## Contents

* 📁 **`Prima Relazione/`** – This report focused on **FPGA programming and experimentation**.
  We completed a series of exercises on programmable logic, documented our process, and discussed key concepts. This folder contains the complete **PDF report**.

* 📁 **`Seconda Relazione/`** – A data analysis project based on a **TV AC (thermal vacuum) test log**.
  This work was written entirely in **Python** and divided into three chapters:

  * Context of the test and environmental simulation (extreme temperatures and vacuum)
  * Python implementation for log file parsing and class design
  * Visualization of key parameters using plots (e.g. shroud temperature and pressure over time)

* 📁 **`Terza Relazione/`** – A combined study of **Fourier transforms** and **TCP/IP communication**:

  * Part 1: Signal generation, analysis, and synthesis using Fourier Series and FFT
  * Part 2: Signal transmission using **Python sockets**, with two separate programs (sender and receiver)
  * The folder includes the **full code** and related **report**

* 📁 **`Quarta Relazione/`** – Audio signal analysis and frequency domain processing project.
  The program:

  * Reads and visualizes audio waveforms
  * Applies **FFT** to analyze frequency content
  * Identifies peaks and translates them into musical notes
  * Implements a **low-pass filter**
  * Saves processed files
    All steps are described in a **single-chapter report**, with annotated **Python code** included.

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates the range of practical skills developed in the *Sistemi Elettronici e Sensori per l'Informatica* course, including:

* **FPGA development**
* **Python-based data analysis**
* **Fourier Transform applications**
* **Signal transmission over networks**
* **Digital signal processing of audio data**
